So far, the game board has been designed and several key variables have been initialized. A frog has been added, along with two cars and a log. It is also possible to set the speed (in pixels per second) of each car and the log. The keys do not yet control the motion of the frog.

I spent approximately four hours working on this assignment thus far.
