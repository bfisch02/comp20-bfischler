In addition to the basic requirements, my Frogger game contains the following implementations:

1) A timer has been implemented, giving the player only 30 seconds to reach the end of the screen
	> The player earns 10 points per remaining second on the timer
2) Frogger is animated to dead_frog.png if he gets run over by a vehicle, hits water, or misses home
3) Level progression has been implemented, so each new level contains faster cars, logs, and turtles
4) A fly shows up at random times, and the player earns 200 extra points when Frogger eats it

Overall, I spend between 20 and 30 hours on this assignment.
