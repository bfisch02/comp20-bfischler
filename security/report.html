<a name="introduction"></a><h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
<span class="italic">Scorecenter</span> is a web application that allows for the recording of high scores for all HTML5 games. In a given html5 game, a jQuery ".post" command can be used to post data including game title, username, score, and date, and this information is stored in a mongo database from which <span class="italic">Scorecenter</span> reads its information. The <span class="italic">Scorecenter</span> homepage contains a table that lists all the high scores that have been posted to the mongo database. <span class="italic">Scorecenter</span> also has a GET API at /highscores.json that provides the top ten scores in descending order for a given game as a JSON string. In addition, a GET API at /usersearch provides a table of scores for a given username.

<a name="methodology"></a><h1>Methodology</h1>
<p>
The <span class="italic">Scorecenter</span> homepage has been launched at <a href="http://high-scores.herokuapp.com">http://high-scores.herokuapp.com</a>, and the source code can be found at the same page. To test the security of the application, I began by visiting each page and testing the functionality of the website as any user would: I browsed the homepage, searched for specific users, and requested JSON strings. I then tried posting to the web application through my own Frogger HTML5 game, experimenting with unexpected inputs like html tags to attack the high scores page. Next, I explored the capabilities of Burp Suite, using it to intercept http requests and manipulate user input. Finally, I reviewed the application's source code to find any potential security leaks.
