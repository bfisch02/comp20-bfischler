<a name="introduction"></a><h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
<span class="italic">Scorecenter</span> is a web application that allows for the recording of high scores for all HTML5 games. In a given HTML5 game, a jQuery ".post" command can be used to post data including game title, username, score, and date, and this information is stored in a mongo database from which <span class="italic">Scorecenter</span> reads its information. The <span class="italic">Scorecenter</span> homepage contains a table that lists all the high scores that have been posted to the mongo database. <span class="italic">Scorecenter</span> also has a GET API at /highscores.json that provides the top ten scores in descending order for a given game as a JSON string. In addition, a GET API at /usersearch provides a table of scores for a given username.

</p>
<a name="methodology"></a><h1>Methodology</h1>
<p>
The <span class="italic">Scorecenter</span> homepage has been launched at <a href="http://high-scores.herokuapp.com">http://high-scores.herokuapp.com</a>, and the source code can be found at the same page. To test the security of the application, I began by visiting each page and testing the functionality of the website as any user would: I browsed the homepage, searched for specific users, and requested JSON strings. I then tried posting to the web application through my own Frogger HTML5 game, experimenting with unexpected inputs like html tags to attack the high scores page. Next, I explored the capabilities of Burp Suite, using it to intercept http requests and manipulate user input. Finally, I reviewed the application's source code to find any potential security leaks.

</p>
<a name="abstract"></a><h1>Abstract of Findings</h1>
<p>
Various security issues were discovered in the <span class="italic">Scorecenter</span> web application, and most of them stem from either (1) faulty mongo database management and web protection or (2) lack of input sanitization. Specific security errors are outlined below.
<ol>
	<li class="large"> Faulty Mongo Database Management / Web Protection
		<ul>
			<li> No more than one high score can be added to the web application without
				 crashing the application.
			</li>
			<li> The web application sets "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" to "*" to enable 
			     cross-domain ajax calls, which means that sharing is allowed with every 
			     origin that tries to access the app.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
	</li>
	<li class="large"> Lack of Input Sanitization 
		<ul>
			<li> There is no input validation for user submissions into the mongo
				 database, which means that the user can submit potentially malicious 
				 html script tags to manipulate the layout of the web application.
			</li>
			<li> There is also no input validation for the /usersearch API, meaning that
				 the user can input malicious html tags in the username textbox.
			</li>
			<li> There is no limit to the size of the user input, which means that the
				 user can submit data that is large enough to destroy the layout of the
				 high scores table, or even to crash the website if the input is long
				 enough.
		</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<a name="issues"></a><h1>Issues Found</h1>
<p>
<ol>
	<li class="large"> High Score Input Error
		<ul>
			<li> <span class="bold">Issue</span>: Faulty Mongo Database Management
			</li>
			<li> <span class="bold">Location</span>: submit.json 
			</li>
			<li> <span class="bold">Severity</span>: <span class="high">HIGH</span> - 
				 Anyone can crash the program simply by submitting a high score.
			</li>
			<li> <span class="bold">Description</span>: The first model of the <span
				 class="italic">Scorecenter</span> web application contained an 
				 unavoidable bug: submitting more than one high score caused the
				 application to crash. The cause of this error was the use of a <span 
				 class="code">db.close()</span> command that effectively closed <span 
				 class="italic">Scorecenter</span>'s Mongo database after the first high
				 score was submitted. This clearly proved to be a major security error, as
				 anyone could crash the program simply by submitting one or two high 
				 scores.
			</li>
			<li> <span class="bold">Resolution</span>: Simply removing the <span 
				 class="code">db.close()</span> command was enough to fix this security
				 error. The <span class="italic">Scorecenter</span> creator made this
				 change immediately, so as to fulfill the requirements of a previous
				 assignment.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<br> 
	<li class="large"> Enabled Cross-Domain Ajax Calls for All Domains 
		<ul>
			<li> <span class="bold">Issue</span>: Faulty Mongo Database Management / Web
				 Protection
			</li>
			<li> <span class="bold">Location</span>: submit.json 
			</li>
			<li> <span class="bold">Severity</span>: <span class="high">HIGH</span> - 
				 People of all domains can make use of the /submit API
			</li>
			<li> <span class="bold">Description</span>: <span class="italic">Scorecenter 
				 </span> sets "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" to "*" in order to enable 
			     cross-domain ajax calls. Although this has the benefit of allowing
			     any HTML5 game to access submit.json, it is a huge security risk to allow
			     sharing with every origin that tries to access the application. Browsers
			     have a built-in safety feature that prevents cross-domain access, but
			     setting a universal CORS header effectively turns off this safety 
			     feature.
			</li>
			<li> <span class="bold">Resolution</span>: Rather than allowing cross-domain
				 ajax calls for all origins, it would be considerably more secure to
				 include an array of allowed domains, and then to only allow cross-domain
				 sharing if the calling domain falls in the list of allowed domains. The
				 code for this procedure would look as follows: <br><br>
				 
<span class="code">
if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_TYPE"] === "OPTIONS") // special CORS track <br>
{ <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;$allowed_domains = array("..."); // Allowed domains listed in quotes <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;$calling_domain = get_calling_domain($_SERVER); <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;if (in_array($calling_domain, $allowed_domains)) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin: " . $calling_domain); <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;exit; // no need to do anything else for OPTION request   <br>
}</span>

			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<br>
	<li class="large"> No Input Validation for User Submission
		<ul>
			<li> <span class="bold">Issue</span>: Lack of Input Validation
			</li>
			<li> <span class="bold">Location</span>: submit.json
			</li>
			<li> <span class="bold">Severity</span>: <span class="high">HIGH</span> - 
				 Malicious script tags may be submitted into the web application.
			</li>
			<li> <span class="bold">Description</span>: <span class="italic"> Scorecenter 
				 </span> fails to check for special characters like brackets in user
				 submissions, which means that the user can easily add script tags that
				 riddle the root of the web application with annoying alerts and page 
				 redirects. For example, if a username of <span class="code">
				 &#60;script&#62;while(1){alert("Hello!");}&#60;/script&#62;</span>
				 is submitted, <span class="italic"> Scorecenter</span>'s root page will
				 load with an infinite loop of "Hello!" alerts.
			</li>
			<img id="hackPic1" src="HackPic1.png"><br>
			<li> <span class="bold">Resolution</span>: JavaScript has a built in <span
				 class="code">replace()</span> function that can be used to rid user
				 input of all HTML tags. If <span class="code">
				 username=username.replace(/&#60;/g, "");</span> is added to the
				 submit.json API, all open brackets will be removed, thereby preventing
				 the insertion of malicious HTML tags into the web app.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<br>
	<li class="large"> No Input Validation for User Search
		<ul>
			<li> <span class="bold">Issue</span>: Lack of Input Validation
			</li>
			<li> <span class="bold">Location</span>: /usersearch
			</li>
			<li> <span class="bold">Severity</span>: <span class="low">LOW</span> - 
				 The user may enter malicious script tags into the usersearch textbox, but
				 the search results will only be seen on the user's page
			</li>
			<li> <span class="bold">Description</span>: <span class="italic"> Scorecenter 
				 </span> also fails to check for special characters like brackets in the
				 usersearch API, which means that the user can input script tags that add
				 alerts and redirects to the page. Chrome and Safari do not allow for
				 script requests to be made (the JavaScript console returns "<span 
				 class="code">Refused to execute a JavaScript script. Source code of
				 script found within request.</span>"), but Firefox does not include this
				 protective feature.
			</li>
			<img id="hackPic2" src="HackPic2.png"><br>
			<li> <span class="bold">Resolution</span>: This security issue can also be
				 solved with JavaScript's built-in <span class="code">replace()</span>
				 function, which can remove all brackets to prevent the use of HTML tags.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<br> 
	<li class="large"> No Maximum Length for User Submission
		<ul>
			<li> <span class="bold">Issue</span>: Lack of Input Validation
			</li>
			<li> <span class="bold">Location</span>: submit.json
			</li>
			<li> <span class="bold">Severity</span>: <span class="medium">MEDIUM</span> - 
				 The user may theoretically crash the web application by submitting a
				 massive amount of text in the username field.
			</li>
			<li> <span class="bold">Description</span>: <span class="italic"> Scorecenter 
				 </span> does not set a maximum user input length for submissions to the 
				 mongo database. In theory, the user could enter such a long username that
				 the entire web application can no longer load. If nothing else, an
				 extremely long username would throw off the layout of the high scores
				 table at the root of the web application.
			</li>
			<li> <span class="bold">Resolution</span>: This security issue can be avoided
				 by creating a new 'username2' variable that only contains the first ten 
				 or fifteen characters of the user input. The code would appear as 
				 follows: <br><br>

<span class="code">
var username = request.body.username;
var username2 = "";
for (i=0; i<10; i++)
&nbsp;&nbsp;username2+=username[i];
}</span>
 
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ol>
