<a name="introduction"></a><h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
<span class="italic">Scorecenter</span> is a web application that allows for the recording of high scores for all HTML5 games. In a given HTML5 game, a jQuery ".post" command can be used to post data including game title, username, score, and date, and this information is stored in a mongo database from which <span class="italic">Scorecenter</span> reads its information. The <span class="italic">Scorecenter</span> homepage contains a table that lists all the high scores that have been posted to the mongo database. <span class="italic">Scorecenter</span> also has a GET API at /highscores.json that provides the top ten scores in descending order for a given game as a JSON string. In addition, a GET API at /usersearch provides a table of scores for a given username.

<a name="methodology"></a><h1>Methodology</h1>
<p>
The <span class="italic">Scorecenter</span> homepage has been launched at <a href="http://high-scores.herokuapp.com">http://high-scores.herokuapp.com</a>, and the source code can be found at the same page. To test the security of the application, I began by visiting each page and testing the functionality of the website as any user would: I browsed the homepage, searched for specific users, and requested JSON strings. I then tried posting to the web application through my own Frogger HTML5 game, experimenting with unexpected inputs like html tags to attack the high scores page. Next, I explored the capabilities of Burp Suite, using it to intercept http requests and manipulate user input. Finally, I reviewed the application's source code to find any potential security leaks.

<a name="abstract"></a><h1>Abstract of Findings</h1>
<p>
Various security issues were discovered in the <span class="italic">Scorecenter</span> web application, and most of them stemm from either (1) faulty mongo database management or (2) lack of input sanitization. Specific security errors are outlined below.
<ol>
	<li class="large"> Faulty Mongo Database Management 
		<ul>
			<li> No more than one high score can be added to the web application without
				 crashing the application.
			</li>
			<li> The web application sets "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" to "*" to enable 
			     cross-domain ajax calls, which means that sharing is allowed with every 
			     origin that tries to access the app.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
	</li>
	<li class="large"> Lack of Input Sanitization 
		<ul>
			<li> There is no input validation for user submissions into the mongo
				 database, which means that the user can submit potentially malicious 
				 html script tags to manipulate the layout of the web application.
			</li>
			<li> There is also no input validation for the /usersearch API, meaning that
				 the user can input malicious html tags in the username textbox.
			</li>
			<li> There is no limit to the size of the user input, which means that the
				 user can submit data that is large enough to destroy the layout of the
				 high scores table, or even to crash the website if the input is long
				 enough.
		</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<a name="issues"></a><h1>Issues Found</h1>
<p>
<ol>
	<li class="large"> High Score Input Error
		<ul>
			<li> <span class="bold">Issue</span>: Faulty Mongo Database Management
			</li>
			<li> <span class="bold">Location</span>: submit.json 
			</li>
			<li> <span class="bold">Severity</span>: <span class="high">High</span> - 
				 Anyone can crash the program simply by submitting a high score.
			</li>
			<li> <span class="bold">Description</span>: The first model of the <span
				 class="italic">Scorecenter</span> web application contained an 
				 unavoidable bug: submitting more than one high score caused the
				 application to crash. The cause of this error was the use of a <span 
				 class="code">db.close()</span> command that effectively closed <span 
				 class="italic">Scorecenter</span>'s Mongo database after the first high
				 score was submitted. This clearly proved to be a major security error, as
				 anyone could crash the program simply by submitting one or two high 
				 scores.
			</li>
		</ul>
